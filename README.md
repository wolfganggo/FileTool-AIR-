# FileTool-AIR-
FileConverter is a tool that is best built with Adobe FlashBuilder but it can also be compiled with the command line version of the Flex compiler.
The program uses Adobe AIR what is a stand-alone container for Adobe Flash, thus both must be installed to run the program.
The program was first created as a simple tool to convert PNG images to ASCII files, so they can be included in source files. Later the tool was extended to be able to browse any files very effective and to do some not so common editing operations. The tool displays images, movies, plays sound files and displays all other files as text. In binary display mode all files are shown as hex dump. Double click on images opens an image window with ability to zoom and pan and to walk through the images in the current directory. Alternatively a thumbnail window can be opened first. Double click on all other files opens the text editor that has nine clipboard memories. Another text editor can edit the files binary, where also the null character has a text representation. In this editor you can for example search and replace all '\r\n\n' with a single '\n'.
